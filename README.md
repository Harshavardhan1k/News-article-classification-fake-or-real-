📰 Fake News Detection using NLP

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing techniques. Using a labeled dataset collected from Kaggle, we preprocess the text with NLTK (removing stopwords, stemming, etc.), convert it into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization, and train a Logistic Regression model. The model is then deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple user interface where anyone can input a news statement and get an instant prediction. This helps demonstrate how machine learning can assist in identifying misinformation in real-world news content.

🎯 Objective :- Classify news articles as fake or real based on their content using NLP and a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset.

🛠 Tools & Technologies 

🔹Python

🔹 Pandas, NumPy

🔹Scikit-learn

🔹NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

🔹Streamlit

🚀 How to Run Locally

Run the Streamlit app:
